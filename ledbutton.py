#LED Circuit
#Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to GPIO pin 18 (physical pin 12).
#Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to a 220Î© resistor.
#Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND).

#Button Circuit
#Connect one side of the button to GPIO pin 17 (physical pin 11).
#Connect the other side of the button to GND.

# Setup GPIO mode
